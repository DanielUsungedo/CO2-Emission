<h1>ANALYSIS OF CO2 EMISSION RATES FROM 1990-2019</h1>

 ### [CO2 EMISSION VISUALIZATION](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjBkYTI4NmQtNzQ1NC00OTBmLTlkOWItYjE0NDYyODZjMzkyIiwidCI6ImVjNGUyZDg4LTI3ODgtNGQ5Yi1hMjE0LTcyZGRhZDU4OGVkNyJ9)

<h2>Description</h2>
The visualization explores CO2 emissions data from 194 countries from 1990 to 2019. CO2 emissions are constantly terrorizing the Earth, and the consequences, such as rising global temperatures, are massively destructive. Hence my interest in this analysis.Â 
I began by cleaning up the data by removing countries with no values. I needed to know which countries have increased their CO2 emission rate over time, which countries have decreased their CO2 emission rate over time, and the growth trend or rate of these emissions over time.
This was accomplished by grouping the years into sets of five years ((1990-1994), (1995-1999), etc.) and then grouping them by various regions (e.g subsaharan Africa). This made the visualization more efficient and concise.

<h2>Tools Employed</h2>

- <b>Power BI</b> 
- <b>SQL</b>

<h2>Metrics to be determined </h2>

Nations whose rate of CO2 emissions has decreased over time

Countries with progressively higher CO2 emissions

CO2 emissions growth rate from 1990 to 2019

Total emissions by nation, expressed as metric ton per capita.

<h2>Visualization:</h2>

I used a filled map to show the various emission rates of all 194 countries for the various years, expressed in metric tons per capita.

I used a stacked column chart to show the total emission rate per country over time, nations whose CO2 emissions rate has decreased over time (Denmark is an excellent example), and countries with progressively higher CO2 emissions (top oil producing countries and China being great examples).

Using an area chart, I discovered that the emission rate increased significantly from 1990 to 2004, decreased minimally from 2005 to 2014, and dropped substantially from 2014 to 2019.
North America leads the way in terms of CO2 emission rates across regions, with Qatar leading the way among countries.
